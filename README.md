# 11ASE_Task_1
This task is about developing a data science program, which can allow users to search for data from an API that they want to know about. please see PROJECT_DEVELOPMENT.md for more information.

# AlxWeather
AlxWeather is a lightweight GUI made in Tkinter that uses the API made by https://weatherapi.com to find weather in any available city.

## Installation
First, clone this repository and navigate to the root directory.

To install the required dependencies, install requirements.txt which can be done by opening a terminal/cmd window in the root folder and typing ``pip install -r requirements.txt``, which will automatically install all the things you will need to run the program. Make sure to check for updates constantly!

Regarding the API key, you may use the provided one, but if the API request limit runs out, you will need to get your own. To do this, just sign up for an account in the link provided and get your key, replacing the old one with your personal one in api.py, where it says: ``API_KEY="string of numbers"``. Replace the string of numbers (not the quotation marks) with your own, and you are good to go to run the program.
